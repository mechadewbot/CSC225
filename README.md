# CSC225
Code for CSC225 at UIS
This is my code. It is not what I would call "beautiful", but it all functions as it should. For the most part. 
I also worked very hard on these projects. Most of the time.
That being said, if you are taking this class at UIS (or any other University/College/School), do NOT copy my code. Please do your own
work. 
Other than that, here's my first semester's worth of Java programming. Enjoy!
